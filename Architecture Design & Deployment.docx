 System Architecture & Deployment Overview
Architecture Components:
•	Local Image Storage: Images stored on local disk for indexing.
•	Vector DB Creation: Uses Azure GPT-4o-mini model to create image descriptions; embeds descriptions with text-embedding-3-small.
•	FAISS Vector Database: Stores embeddings and metadata for efficient image retrieval.
•	FastAPI Backend: Loads FAISS index and exposes REST API for semantic image search.
•	Streamlit UI: Frontend app calls FastAPI endpoints to query and display image results.
•	Azure OpenAI Integration: Powers description generation and embedding creation.
Deployment Process:
•	Docker Containerization: Entire app run inside a Docker container ensuring consistency across environments.
•	Azure Container Registry (ACR): Docker image is pushed and stored securely.
•	Azure Web App Service: Pulls container from ACR and hosts the combined FastAPI + Streamlit services.
•	Single Port Access: Azure Web App exposes one external port, used by FastAPI.
•	Streamlit Access: Streamlit runs headlessly inside container and is accessed internally via FastAPI /streamlit endpoint.
•	Docker Configuration: Dockerfile exposes required ports dynamically and installs dependencies.
